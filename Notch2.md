Exomes of six patients affected by the Hajdu Cheney syndrome.

The short reads were mapped to the Human genome using bwa 0.5.9  and the variants were called with samtools mpileup 0.1.17.
Homozygous variants, known SNPs (from dbSNP), and poor-quality variants were discarded.
In 45 minutes, our Knime pipeline generated a list of 6 genes: CELSR1, COL4A2, MAGEF1, MYO15A, ZNF341 and  more importantly NOTCH2 the expected candidate gene.
