#summary search for a functional region

We want to know whether a mutation is contained within the functional region of a protain

Use a 'Uniprot' Node

==Source table==



The columns: the chromosme, the position and the position of the mutation in the protein

we add a UCSC SQL node to find the knownGenes overlapping that mutation:
